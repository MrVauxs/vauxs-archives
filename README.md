Previously meant to be in Vauxs Chat Enhancements, this module is just the archives feature.

## ~~TODO~~ Features

- [x] Chat Archives - Create archives of the chat log and browse them in-game.
  - [x] Quick Search - Be able to search the archives for specific messages.
  - [x] Quick Archive - Replace the "Export Chat Log" button with a Vauxs' Archives button.
  - [x] Edit Archive - Edit the name, description, and date of a given archive.
  - [x] Sort Archives - Sort archives Alphabetically or Date of creation.
  - [x] Render 1:1 - The archive is an accurate recreation of how the chatlog was rendered at the time.
  - [x] Foundry to Discord integration - ~~Allow the messages to not be deleted on Discord when archiving them.~~ If your message count is higher than 10, FtD won't delete the messages anyway.
  - [x] DFCE integration - Be able to read DFCE archives. Likely to be achieved by manually pointing at the JSON file.

## Maybe

- [ ] 'Cron' Archive - Archive (and opt. prune) the chat automatically once the oldest message passes the threshold of ex. a week.
- [ ] Rolls Summary - See the rolls of a given archive summarized, per user.

## Won't Do

- Chat Merging - You have plenty of other UI modules for that.
- Saving to Journals - Never used it, found it clunky at best.
- Parsing .txt or .html files

### Warning!

Due to DF Chat Enhancements feature of limiting the amount of messages being rendered at once (which Foundry already does as of v10!) it breaks the rendering on chat logs on Vauxs' Archives.
**You cannot have both of these modules enabled simultaneously.**
